        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Filled dumplings made by wrapping unleavened dough around a savoury or sweet filling and cooking with water</p>
        <p>Pierogi are associated mainly with the Central and Eastern European Cuisine, though they most likely originated in China and were introduced in Europe during the Middle Ages</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>One teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>3 Large eggs</li>
            <li>5 ounces cream cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor, combine flour and salt; cover and pulse to blend. Add water, eggs and butter; cover and pulse until dough forms a ball, adding an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed. Let rest, covered, 15 to 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until tender, 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute onions in butter until tender</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes. Over very low heat, stir potatoes until steam has evaporated, 1-2 minutes. Press through a potato ricer or strainer into a large bowl. Stir in cream cheese, salt, pepper and onion mixture</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 4 parts. On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 portion of dough to 1/8-in. thickness; cut with a floured 3-in. biscuit cutter. Place 2 teaspoons of filling in center of each circle. Moisten edges with water; fold in half and press edges to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and filling</li>
        </ol>
